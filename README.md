# Link-Page
A linktree clone created, following a youtube tutorial. A future idea of mine is to actually create something like this for gamers. This will be good reference after learning more about APIs, JS, React, and React Natave. 
I also plan on using this for my personal portfolio in the future. Maybe I can spoce up the background and make it animated.
